You hereby represent and warrant to Spatial that You are authorized to act on such Organization&rsquo;s behalf in accepting the terms of this Agreement, and You have made sure that You have the necessary authority to enter into this Agreement on its behalf. If You only intend to pay for and use the Service for Your own benefit</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c7">as an individual, then You are Spatial&rsquo;s customer [Customer], otherwise, the Organization is the primary Customer and You would be a user, and are bound to respect obligations and restrictions applicable to Users.

Any Spatial terms and conditions that appear in or on, or accompany, any Spatial Software, Materials, items or services also apply and bind You in connection with Your use of and access to the Service.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">By agreeing to use the Service below, and using it, You accept these Terms of Service.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If You do not accept them, or if You are acting on behalf of an Organization but You are not authorized to bind the Organization on whose behalf You are subscribing to the Service, do not download or use the Software or Service. You as an individual also represent that You are 18 or older, otherwise You are not permitted to enter into this Agreement and should not use the Service.&nbsp;<br><br></span><span class="c1">1. THE BASIC LICENSE<br>&zwj;</span><span class="c2">Subject to the terms of this Agreement,&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">You (the Customer, or if the Customer is an Organization, You the User) are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive, non-transferable and royalty-free right and license to use the Service including any Spatial-provided Materials solely during the Term (as defined below) for Your work, creativity, socializing, collaboration and production during the Term.&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">The Software is licensed to You for Your use during the Term, but not sold to You.&nbsp; However, You have the right to download and use the Service on Your preferred computers and devices, provided that all use of the Service is by You, that is, Your own use and not use by any other person.&nbsp; You have no right to sublicense it to others, nor to assign any rights granted to You by this Agreement or to give Your login credentials to any other person. However, You may encourage Your colleagues and friends to sample Spatial&rsquo;s Service; enthusiastic Users of Spatial often help to expand use within an Organization and/or among peers and colleagues.<br><br></span><span class="c1">2. SCOPE OF USE <br>Your license to the Service gives You the right to use and sample the Service during the Term, subject to the limits that apply to the particular license You obtain</span><span class="c2">, as may be indicated in Your Order Form or in a notification from Spatial, as Spatial is constantly enhancing functionality</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Spatial will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide You with online notice, or notice to Your account, in the event it imposes or modifies technical or numerical limitations on use or makes available new features. This Agreement covers the Free and the paid Plus versions of the Spatial Service, as well as the version sometimes favored by larger organizations called Enterprise, and may cover new options released in the future.&nbsp; Spatial reserves the right to apply technical and/or numerical limitations on use of the features it now makes available and will make available in the Service, which may vary by the version of license to the Service that You obtain.&nbsp; Such limitations and/or User options on features in the Service may include without limitation: (i) the amount of time that each session or meeting can last, (ii) the number of people who can join the meeting or &ldquo;Space&rdquo; (defined below; formerly called Room) simultaneously&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">[Concurrent Users]</span><span class="c2">, (iii) the number of &ldquo;Spaces&rdquo; that people can save for future use/reference; (iv) the volume of Customer Content (as defined in Section 8) uploaded; (v) integration of the Service with other software, and (vi) other enhanced features pertaining to operational, organizational and security management.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Space&rdquo; is the virtual locale where You can upload Customer Content as well as meet and interact with other Users&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">[Space]</span><span class="c2 c7">. There is no limit on how many times You can use the Service during the Term. Larger organizations that may have special needs and potentially many Users may opt to enter into a separate agreement with Spatial for the Enterprise version of the Service, in which case this Agreement shall apply to the extent it does not conflict with or is superseded by the Enterprise agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">3. ATTRIBUTION TO SPATIAL</span><span class="c2"><br>Use of Spatial&rsquo;s Service to provide a service to Your own customers, including without limitation creating or setting up Space(s) for the benefit of Your customers, building or offering custom content or environments for Your customer, providing onboarding or any type of support for any content or Space created with the Service&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">is strictly prohibited UNLESS clear attribution</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">to Spatial</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is given as follows.&nbsp; Your customer must know that You have used Spatial&rsquo;s Service to enable You to provide Your own services, and that Your customer&rsquo;s use of any Space (but not the Customer Content created by You) is provided courtesy of Spatial.&nbsp; The Space or any content that You create and provide to such customer must clearly indicate in a very visible matter a link to Spatial&rsquo;s website homepage,</span><span class="c2 c4"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.spatial.io/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1665779693303215&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jgPrqgZ1XBrvn5xpBWvH7">&nbsp;https://www.spatial.io</a></span><span class="c2">, so that the Your customer/user is made aware that he/she/it may access and use Spatial&rsquo;s Service independently from Your services.&nbsp; In addition You must visibly differentiate for Your users&rsquo;/customers&rsquo; benefit what You have provided, and what portion of the services that You have provided derive from Spatial&rsquo;s Service/platform.&nbsp; Spatial reserves the right to disable Your account in the event that You do not provide adequate attribution to Spatial in connection with any such services You offer.<br><br></span><span class="c1">4. CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND USER ACCESS</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;<br>You will need to set up Your account on Spatial&rsquo;s website,&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c4"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.spatial.io/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1665779693303723&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ebpt-kIL25XmnbQ8tsYxQ">https://www.spatial.io</a></span><span class="c2">.&nbsp; Customer may only permit Users it has authorized to use the Service; provided that (i) the number of Users does not exceed any User Limit that You agreed to on Your online Order Form, which may present You with various Service options; and (ii) Customer must ensure that each User complies with all applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement (including applicable privacy policies, acceptable use policies and other general terms and conditions), and is fully and directly responsible to Spatial for any act or omission by each User in connection with their use of the Service, whether such User is an employee, contractor or agent of Customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer will, and will require all Users to, use all reasonable means to secure User names and passwords, and hardware and software used to access the Service in accordance with customary security protocols, and will promptly notify Spatial if Customer knows or reasonably suspects that any User name and/or password has been compromised. Each account for access to and use of the Service may only be accessed and used by the specific User for whom such account is created. Customer will further ensure that no User misrepresents his or her identity or otherwise provides any deceptive or misleading profile information or images when creating an account and/or a virtual avatar to use with the Service. You as Customer and/or User will have access to Spaces into which certain Customer Content (as defined below) may be uploaded and shared among Users, unless You control access to the Space as explained in Section 11 below. You as Customer and/or User hereby acknowledge and agree that You are solely responsible for managing all access controls, limits and permissions within the Service with respect to Users and their ability to access Spaces or any Customer Content therein.<br><br>&zwj;</span><span class="c1">5. TERM OF LICENSE<br>The license granted to You, which is a subscription license, runs indefinitely for the Free potentially limited-use version of the Service, and for the full-use Spatial Plus version of the Service runs from Your download of the Software onto any computer or device and ends after the time period specified in Your Order Form, normally one (1) year [Term]</span><span class="c2">. The annual Spatial Plus license will renew automatically for additional periods of one (1) year upon Your payment of the renewal invoice, unless either party informs the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the then current initial Term or renewal term that it does not wish to renew the Term.&nbsp; The initial Term and any renewal term constitute the Term. Upon expiration of the Term if You still intend to use the Service, You agree to install and use only the Free public version of the Service (if made available by Spatial), or at Spatial&rsquo;s email request, to delete, uninstall or otherwise remove the Software from any computer, mobile phone or other storage device where it has been downloaded, stored, installed or used.&nbsp; The duration of use of the Enterprise version and the renewal terms will be as agreed with Spatial.<br><br>&zwj;</span><span class="c1">6. PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS&nbsp;<br>&zwj;</span><span class="c2">When You purchase the Plus version of the Service, the fees are specified at checkout in the Order Form, and are paid in advance, and You will have the option at checkout to pay for the entire year, or to pay monthly.&nbsp; If You are joining an existing group of Users&nbsp;and are signing up for Spatial for the first time, You will not be charged for the pro-rated portion of the initial monthly billing cycle, so that You can sample the Service with Your User group.&nbsp; When the next monthly billing period starts, if You continue to use the Service, You will be billed for the new monthly period, as well as for the pro-rated portion of Your past period of use.&nbsp; With the Enterprise version, the fees are also specified in the Order Form. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and the fees are nonrefundable unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement.&nbsp; You can go to Spatial&rsquo;s Help documentation at support.spatial.io for more information about plan offerings and the corresponding payment options.&nbsp; If Spatial agrees in its sole discretion that Customer will be invoiced by email, full payment must be received on net 30-day terms from date of invoice. All fees stated are exclusive of taxes and charges of any nature, such as levies, duties, value-added taxes, excise taxes, use or withholding taxes that may be assessed by any jurisdiction&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">[Taxes].</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes assessed on its purchase or renewal of a license, other than taxes based on Spatial&rsquo;s net income.&nbsp; In the event that Your jurisdiction imposes income tax withholding on Your purchase or renewal of a license, You must gross up Your payment to Spatial so that it yields us the amount of fees stated in the online Order Form.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1"><br><br>7. RESTRICTIONS ON USE AND DISCLOSURE&nbsp;<br>&zwj;</span><span class="c2">When You access or use any Spatial Software or Materials,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;You agree that You will not copy, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software or any portion thereof, nor attempt any activities not expressly permitted by this Agreement.&nbsp; Further, You understand and agree that the Software is the Confidential Information (as defined in Section 10) and property of Spatial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Accordingly, You agree not to disclose the Software nor any Confidential Information about the Software, the Service or Spatial, in whole or in part, to any third party without the prior express written consent of Spatial in each instance.&nbsp; In particular, You will not disclose to any third party or disseminate to the public (except privately to Spatial), publish on the internet or elsewhere any tests run on the Software or results of such tests (if You are using a beta or evaluation version of the Software), or any Feedback concerning the Software or Service without written permission from Spatial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Your opinions and comments are NOT Confidential Information, as long as they do not contain Confidential Information as defined in Section 10.&nbsp; We appreciate Your Feedback (defined in Section 11), and therefore subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, You are free to post and blog about Spatial and Your experience, on Your own website or on social media, and to review and critique our products/Service, tweet out links to galleries and other third parties as You wish.&nbsp;Spatial hosts the Spaces that You may create and/or use on its servers.&nbsp; Consequently Spatial has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor the activities that take place in its Spaces, primarily to ensure that there is no illegal activity taking place in the Spaces, or to respond to information we receive from other Users or third parties. (a) In the event that You undertake activities in any Space or otherwise in Your use of Spatial that violate applicable law or that put Spatial&rsquo;s reputation at risk, we have the right to suspend Your account and access to the Service, or take down a given Space, as we deem necessary to ensure that illegal, scandalous, obscene or defamatory activities do not take place. (b) Spatial in no way endorses any activities that You undertake, or products or services that You offer (whether or not for sale) using Spatial or within a Space. You must never in any way, directly or indirectly, imply, insinuate, suggest or state that Spatial endorses or sponsors any activities, offers, products or services undertaken, advertised, promoted or offered by You.&nbsp; In the event we deem that You have given an impression or even created ambiguity about this issue, we will ask or if we deem it necessary require You to include a prominent statement in Your Space or advertisement/offer stating that Spatial neither sponsors nor endorses the activity, service or product that You are promoting or offering.&nbsp; (c) Spatial hereby disclaims all liability that might arise from any claim relating to any activity that takes place in a Space or using Spatial, including without limitation any promotional or sales activity by or deriving from any act or omission of any User of the Service or visitor to any Space, unless otherwise indicated in this Agreement. You agree to indemnify and hold Spatial harmless should any liability arise from Your conduct if it violates the restrictions set forth in this paragraph.</span><span class="c1"><br></span><span class="c2"><br>&zwj;</span><span class="c1">8. OWNERSHIP<br>&zwj;</span><span class="c2">The Service, Software and any Materials provided by Spatial or obtained or accessed by You from Spatial or its agents shall remain the sole property of Spatial and its successors assigns, and under no circumstances may be used in any way other than pursuant to this Agreement or other agreement between You and Spatial, nor may any Software or Materials, or Service, be retained, sold, or reproduced by any means by You except as specified in this Agreement or the Spatial documentation, and You shall have no intellectual property rights, including but not limited to trade secrets, trademarks, patent rights, copyrights and moral rights in the Service or any of the Software and Materials&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">[Intellectual Property Rights]</span><span class="c2">, and upgrades, updates and derivative works thereto.&nbsp; No right or license is granted to You or to any third party by implication, estoppel or otherwise, other than the express rights set forth in this Agreement. Spatial may discontinue development of the Software at any time, which will not affect Your subscription license during the Term.&nbsp; Any rights that You acquire in such Service, Software and/or Materials, other than the license rights granted by this Agreement, are hereby assigned to Spatial, including all intellectual property rights that You may have or acquire anywhere in the world (including moral rights, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law), and any other rights You may have pertaining to the Service provided by or made accessible by Spatial.&nbsp; You will not attempt to register any Intellectual Property Rights anywhere in the world.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Customer (whether You or the Organization You represent) retains all rights in all content not provided by or made accessible by Spatial that You use in Spaces with the Service&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">[Customer Content]</span><span class="c2">, or which is used more broadly as described in Section 11 below, and in any personally identifiable information or personal data&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">[PII]&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">that Users and/or Customers provide to Spatial to facilitate provisioning of the Service, which remains the property of the data subjects who provided such PII, except as otherwise indicated in Section 11 below.&nbsp; The PII that is provided to Spatial in order to establish accounts and provide the Service consists of User name, email address, and may include a photo/image to create the User avatar, and GPS or location information about the User.&nbsp; Given that You may choose to create an avatar that is not a photo or image of You, such avatar may not constitute PII. Similarly, a User name that You choose to use with Your Customer Content that is accessible to other Users and possibly to the public but which is not Your actual name also may not constitute PII. So whether You choose to publicly list PII is basically Your choice. All &nbsp;PII remains the property of the Customer/User/data subject. In other words, what Spatial brings to the relationship remains Spatial&rsquo;s property subject to its ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights at all times, and the content that You introduce to a Space or the PII that You provide Spatial (as between You and Spatial) remains Your property at all times.&nbsp; Your Feedback becomes Spatial&rsquo;s property as indicated below, as does any derivative work of the Software, Materials or Service.<br><br>&zwj;</span><span class="c1">9.

Providing the Service.</span><span class="c2"><br>We provide the Service to You, and make sure You receive adequate Support Services.&nbsp; We use great efforts to ensure that the Services operate materially in accordance with our online Help documentation at support.spatial.io and other documentation, with the requisite security described in the next paragraph.&nbsp; We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide support services adequate to Your needs for the Free version of the Service, and for the Plus and Enterprise versions of the Service, to ensure that the Service will be available to You 24/7 excluding planned or emergency downtime. We will try to keep You informed of any necessary downtime.<br>&zwj;<br></span><span class="c1">B. Protecting Customer Content and Personal Data.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;<br>Both in providing the Service, and in protecting Confidential Information, Your Customer Content and personal data, we use physical, operational and technical safeguards that we believe are adequate to the task and high industry standards, even though it is not possible to guarantee absolute security online, and we always try to ensure that all such safeguards comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws as they evolve.&nbsp; In addition, our interaction with Your Customer Content and personal data/PII is in accordance with our Privacy Policy at spatial.io/privacy, which is intended to comply with applicable privacy and data protection legislation, including without limitation GDPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1"><br><br>10. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION<br>&zwj;</span><span class="c2">For purposes of this Agreement, &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; includes innovations, any information, knowledge or data of either party which the other party and its employees may access or receive relating to the Service, Software, Materials, code, computer programs, accounting methods, marketing techniques, customer names, negotiated customer fee information, financial information, marketing plans, product plans, product or services roadmaps, business strategies, forecasts, personnel information, customer lists, trade secrets and any other nonpublic technical or business information, whether in writing, given to the recipient orally or in any other way communicated or provided to the recipient, which the recipient knows or has reason to know that discloser would like to treat as confidential for any purpose, such as maintaining a competitive advantage or avoiding undesirable publicity.&nbsp; The Service, Software and any nonpublic documentation shall remain the Confidential Information of Spatial at all times. Neither party as the recipient shall disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, and neither party shall use any Confidential Information of the disclosing party except with respect to You as recipient, to properly use the license granted under this Agreement, or with respect to Spatial as recipient, only to the extent necessary to provide and enhance the Service and other services, or assist Your use of the license You have obtained under this Agreement.&nbsp;<br><br>All Confidential Information of the discloser shall be protected from disclosure by the recipient using the standard of care recipient uses with its most valuable confidential information, and at least a commercially reasonable standard of care; and (ii) no Confidential Information of the discloser shall be used for any purpose other than that for which it has been disclosed, and shall not be used for the benefit of recipient or any third party except as permitted by the license to use the Service and/or by this Agreement. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is in the public domain through no fault of the recipient; (b) was known to recipient prior to disclosure by the discloser without breach of an obligation to discloser, as can be demonstrated by documentary evidence; (c) was disclosed to recipient by a third party not known by recipient to be under a confidentiality obligation to discloser; (d) was independently developed by recipient without use of Confidential Information of discloser.&nbsp; If required by law or court or governmental order, recipient can disclose Confidential Information of discloser, but recipient first shall give discloser the opportunity to oppose or limit such disclosure, and shall never disclose more than recipient is required to disclose.<br><br>&zwj;</span><span class="c1">11.&nbsp; RIGHTS IN CUSTOMER CONTENT; USER PROFILE; FOLLOWING <br></span><span class="c2">With respect to Your rights in Customer Content (which term is defined in Section 8 above), You represent and warrant that You either own, or have all necessary rights to submit to Spatial and post, Customer Content, which may include PII.
