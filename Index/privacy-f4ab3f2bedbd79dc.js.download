Your Spatial profile consists of the user name that you choose and the avatar that you wish to use (whether these are identifiable to you, like a photo, or not)(collectively, &ldquo;Profile&rdquo;). It also includes the list of people whom you follow and who follow you. &nbsp;Your Profile is publicly visible and searchable, and you have the option in your sole discretion to add a bio (and preferred links), which may include additional personal information. You may choose to share your Spaces with other users and third parties, along the lines of what you do on other social media sites. &nbsp;Most creators of Spaces wish to share Spaces (including your Content) with users and third parties, and on other social media sites, in order to obtain followers. You can also follow other users and &ldquo;like&rdquo; their Spaces. The default setting to obtain followers would be your public listing of your Space. &nbsp;Publicly listed Spaces are visible and searchable on Spatial&rsquo;s &ldquo;Explore&rdquo; page, and on the user Profile page. However, you can affirmatively choose to keep your Space(s) private, by toggling to ensure that it is not publicly listed. &nbsp;In this manner you can control whether most of your Content (other than your Profile) is visible </span><span class="c34">(i) only to Your invited Users in a Space, (ii) only to the holders of certain crypto tokens (Spaces can be token-gated), or (iii) to anyone under the public listing default option, which latter option will make Your Customer Content in a given Space visible to any follower or third party who has access to the link. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">We also allow you to integrate your Spaces with popular business tools such as Google Drive and Slack, and to upload Content from applications into Spaces to enhance your use of the Services.
